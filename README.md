## How to use this Module

You can use this module from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/unruly/airflow/aws/)

```terraform
module "example-airflow-setup" {
  source            = "unruly/airflow/aws"
  key               = "your-aws-keypair"
  db_password       = "some-db-password"
  fernet_key        = "your-fernet-key"
  vpc_id            = "some-vpc-id"
  security_group_id = "some-security-group-id"
  subnet_ids        = [ "id-1", "id-2" ]
}
```

## Quick-start

In the `./sample` directory, there is a terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) and an Airflow DAG file (`example-dag.py`).

1. Set up Airflow in AWS us-east-1
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var "key_name=<YOUR-AWS-KEYPAIR-NAME>"
   ```
2. Wait until the webserver has started - get the url for Airflow with `terraform output airflow_public_dns` and navigate to it using your browser or curl

3. Copy across the example DAG to the instance
   ```bash
   scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no example-dag.py admin@$(terraform output airflow_public_dns):/home/centos/airflow/dags
   ```
4. Wait for Airflow to pick up the DAG and display it on the page as below

5. Congratulations, you have a running Airflow server in production!

**WARNING - the database passwords and Fernet key are hardcoded in the sample configuration: do not use these in production!**
